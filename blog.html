        <p>Creating my first CS290 assignment was easier than I thought. I expected to face some problems, but everything went well. 
            I've learned a good bit about HTML, especially since this is my first time studying it. I've been excited to take a web 
            development class because I want to create my own website. During this assignment, I learned more about how HTML is 
            structured and how it works. I used the class demo file and opened it in a browser to see how big each header looked, 
            which helped me pick the right ones. Overall, I really enjoyed working with HTML and found it a great experience.
